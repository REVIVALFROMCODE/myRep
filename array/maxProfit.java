/*
 * Here's why this greedy strategy is effective:
 * 
 * Key Reasons:
 * Independent Transactions:
 * 
 * Each opportunity to buy and sell is independent of other days. Whether you
 * buy today and sell tomorrow or next week, it doesn't affect other potential
 * transactions.
 * 
 * Local Profit Maximization:
 * 
 * By capturing every instance where the price increases, you ensure that youâ€™re
 * taking advantage of each profitable opportunity. This local optimization
 * (buying at every local low and selling at every local high) leads to global
 * profit maximization.
 * 
 * Additivity of Profits:
 * 
 * The profit earned from different transactions can be summed up to get the
 * total profit. Therefore, by summing all individual profits from each upward
 * price movement, you achieve the maximum possible profit.
