``Stream``

Here are a few key reasons for the speed advantage of stream ciphers:

Continuous Processing: Stream ciphers don't wait to fill a block of data. They operate on data as it comes, reducing delays.

Simple Algorithms: Stream ciphers often have simpler mathematical operations compared to block ciphers, which translates to faster computation.

No Padding Overhead: Unlike block ciphers, stream ciphers don't require padding to align data to a block size, saving time and reducing complexity.
